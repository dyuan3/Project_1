# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My goal is to clean, transform and analyze data in the first project

## Process
1. Clean data and remove null colmns
2. Look on the data to check how to analyze according to the questions
3. QA process to check if there is any null values

## Results
The data show the relationships between the products quantity among the portfolio of countries and cities when queries have run. The percentage of visitors to the site that actually makes a purchase is quite low about 2.26%. And United States have the greatest purchase of electronics. 

## Challenges 
There are many colomns in these five tables. It is hard to figure out which one the primary key and which is the foreign key.

## Future Goals
I can use join function to analyze more infomation
